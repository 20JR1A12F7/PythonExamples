# Morse code is not what is called 'prefix code' so that
# no encoding of some character could be a prefix of the
# encoding of some other character. Decoding sequences of
# dots and dashes is therefore ambiguous (for example, "..."
# could be either "s" or "eee") unless the operator inserts
# a short pause as an artificial separator between letters.

# Dictionary of Morse codes and their corresponding letters.

# To paraphrase that Heath Ledger Joker meme, nobody has a
# problem when a generator uses some other lazy sequence
# such as range as part of its computation, but make your
# generator recursively use another instance of that same
# type of generator, and everyone loses their minds...

# Since in general there can be an exponential number of ways
# to decode Morse code back to characters, it is essential
# for decode_morse to be lazy so that it decodes these
# messages one at the time, instead of potentially filling
# up the entire process memory. For example, just consider
# the number of different ways to decode a sequence of n
# consecutive dots back to characters:

# Motivated readers could find the largest group of words that
# all encode to the same series of Morse dots and dashes.

# Were Morse code designed today, it would surely be constructed
# as a "Huffman code" to produce the optimal prefix code for the
# individual character frequencies of English. This guarantees
# unique decodability of each sequence of dots and dashes back to
# the original English text. Alas, we cannot fault Samuel Morse
# (1791-1872) for not being aware of all the nifty advances of
# combinatorial algorithms made during the twentieth century...

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding

# Note that Huffman code is optimal only if every character must
# be encoded separately. More advanced compression methods can and
# will automatically exploit the conditional probabilities between
# consecutive letters. For example, after seeing "qui", letters p,
# t and z suddenly become more likely compared to their baseline
# probabilities in English when every letter must be encoded on its
# own, separated from its surrounding context...
