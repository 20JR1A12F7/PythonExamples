# Whenever a problem is stated in terms of integers, you should aim

# two computed floating point values for equality! Since floating point
# values are approximations, it just never makes sense to compare them
# with the operator ==. The most commonly seen Python constructs that
# tend to produce floating point numbers would be ordinary division /
# and sqrt, pow and basically any functions in the math module.

# As an example of how to do things with integers, here is the integer
# root function that finds the largest a so that a**k <= n. Note how
